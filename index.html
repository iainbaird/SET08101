    <p>Earth has expanded to the very edges of the sol system.</p>      
    <p>For the past 400years we have sent out massive starships designed to support the human colonists for the generations it will take for these ships to reach the nearest star systems at sub light speeds.</p>
    <p>Until now</p>
	<p>Earth has not forgotten these brave souls</p>
	<p>Your mission Commander is to travel to the nearest 4 star systems, evaluate the conditions on the planets and report back to Earth so we can send planetary tera formers prior to the colonists arrival </p>
