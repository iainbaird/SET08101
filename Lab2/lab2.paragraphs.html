		<p>Hello Web Tech</p>
		<p>Make an HTML document that incorporates several paragraphs of text. You can select some
text from a news website, or better yet, investigate “greeking” or “lorem ipsum”, a way
to generate blocks of text for testing websites before the ‘copy’, the content of the page, is
written. There are many websites that generate lorem ipsum text as a service for you to
copy and paste into website designs whilst you are waiting for the content to be written.
This can be very useful as you will often want to start experimenting with page layout and
presentation before you have the full content of your site. Often a site grows over time, so
developing a design that doesn’t rely on specific content, but looks good regardless, is useful</p>
		<p>Arguably the most important element in HTML are the tags that support hypertext. These
enable links between pages. They put the “Hyper” into HTML which would otherwise be TexMarkupLanguage (TML) and are also responsible for putting the “web” aspect into the World
Wide Web</p>
